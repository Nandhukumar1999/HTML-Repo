<h2>What is the cursor pointer?</h2>



<p>IThe emoji was predated by the emoticon,[12] a concept implemented in 1982 by computer scientist Scott Fahlman when he suggested text-based symbols such as :-) and :-( could be used to replace language.[13] Theories about language replacement can be traced back to the 1960s, when Russian novelist and professor Vladimir Nabokov stated in an interview with The New York Times: "I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile â€” some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket."[14] It did not become a mainstream concept until the 1990s when Japanese, American and European companies began developing Fahlman's idea.</p>
