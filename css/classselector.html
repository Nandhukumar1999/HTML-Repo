    <h1>Transformers</h1>

    <p class="tf">Transformers is a series of science fiction action films based on the Transformers franchise of the 1980s.[note
        1] Michael Bay directed the first five films: Transformers (2007), Revenge of the Fallen (2009), Dark of the
        Moon (2011), Age of Extinction (2014), and The Last Knight (2017),[1][2][3] and has served as a producer for
        subsequent films. A sixth film Bumblebee, directed by Travis Knight, was released in 2018, while a seventh film,
        Rise of the Beasts, directed by Steven Caple Jr. was released in 2023.

        The series has been distributed by Paramount Pictures, and DreamWorks Pictures worked on the first two films.
        The live action Transformers film series has received negative to mixed reception, except for Bumblebee, which
        received positive reviews. It is the 13th-highest-grossing film series, with a total of $5.28 billion; the
        series films have generally been successful at the box office, with Dark of the Moon and Age of Extinction
        grossing over $1 billion each.</p>

    <p class="af">For the film, producer Don Murphy was planning a G.I. Joe film adaptation, but when the U.S. launched the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Hasbro suggested adapting the Transformers franchise instead.[4] Tom DeSanto joined Murphy because he was a fan of the series.[5] They met with comic book writer Simon Furman, and cited the Generation 1 cartoon and comics as their main influence.[4] They made the Creation Matrix their plot device, though Murphy had it renamed because of the film series The Matrix.[6] DeSanto chose to write the treatment from a human point of view to engage the audience,[7] while Murphy wanted it to have a realistic tone, reminiscent of a disaster film.[6] The treatment featured the Autobots Optimus Prime, Ironhide, Jazz, Prowl, Arcee, Ratchet, Wheeljack, and Bumblebee, and the Decepticons Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Ravage, Laserbeak, Rumble, Skywarp and Shockwave.[8]</p>
