    <p>One-Punch Man (Japanese: ワンパンマン, Hepburn: Wanpanman) is a Japanese superhero manga series created by One. It
        tells the story of Saitama, a superhero who, because he can defeat any opponent with a single punch, grows bored
        from a lack of challenge. One wrote the original webcomic manga version in early 2009.

        A digital manga remake, illustrated by Yusuke Murata, began publication on Shueisha's Tonari no Young Jump
        website in June 2012. Its chapters are periodically compiled and published into individual tankōbon volumes. As
        of June 2023, 28 volumes have been released. In North America, Viz Media has licensed the remake manga for
        English language release and has serialized it in its Weekly Shonen Jump digital magazine.

        An anime adaptation produced by Madhouse was broadcast in Japan from October to December 2015. A second season,
        produced by J.C.Staff, was broadcast from April to July 2019. A third season has been announced. Licensed in
        North America by Viz Media, it premiered in the United States on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in July
        2016. The second season premiered on the block in October 2019.

        By June 2012, the original webcomic manga surpassed 7.9 million hits. By April 2020, the manga remake had sold
        over 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time.</p>
    <p>On a supercontinent version of Earth that has four Moons, powerful monsters and supervillains wreak havoc. The
        millionaire Agoni creates the Hero Association, which employs superheroes to fight evil. Saitama, an
        unassociated hero, hails from City Z and performs heroic deeds as a hobby. For three years, he has trained
        enough to defeat any enemy with a single punch, his unmatched strength leaving him bored. He becomes a reluctant
        mentor to Genos, a cyborg seeking revenge against another cyborg who killed his family and destroyed his
        hometown, after Saitama defeats a monster that defeated Genos.

        Saitama and Genos join the Hero Association, hoping to attain notability, but Genos instantly obtains an S-Class
        rank; meanwhile, due to scoring low on the written exam despite having a perfect score on the physical exam,
        Saitama only becomes a C-Class hero. His feats remain unnoticed even after saving people from an asteroid and
        then a sea monster, barely getting himself promoted to B-Class. Later, shortly before her death, the seer
        Shibabawa predicts that the world is in great danger as the alien Boros invades the planet. The heroes kill the
        invaders and destroy Boros's ship as Saitama defeats Boros in single combat.</p>
