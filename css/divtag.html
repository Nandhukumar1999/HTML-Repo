        <h1>Slogan</h1>
        <p>A slogan is a memorable motto or phrase used in a clan, political, commercial, religious, and other context
            as a repetitive expression of an idea or purpose, with the goal of persuading members of the public or a
            more defined target group. The Oxford Dictionary of English defines a slogan as "a short and striking or
            memorable phrase used in advertising."[1] A slogan usually has the attributes of being memorable, very
            concise and appealing to the audience.</p>
        <p>The word slogan is derived from slogorn which was an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic and Irish
            sluagh-ghairm (sluagh "army", "host" and gairm "cry").[3] Slogans vary from the written and the visual to
            the chanted and the vulgar. Their simple rhetorical nature usually leaves little room for detail, and a
            chanted slogan may serve more as social expression of unified purpose than as communication to an intended
            audience.</p>

        <h2>Likability</h2>
        <p>Crimmins' (2000, as cited in Dass, Kumar, Kohli, & Thomas, 2014) research suggests that brands are an
            extremely valuable corporate asset, and can constitute much of a business's total value. With this in mind,
            if we take into consideration Keller's (1993, as cited in Dass, Kumar, Kohli, & Thomas, 2014) research,
            which suggests that a brand is made up of three different components. These include, name, logo and slogan.
            Brands names and logos both can be changed by the way the receiver interprets them. Therefore, the slogan
            has a large job in portraying the brand (Dass, Kumar, Kohli, & Thomas, 2014).[5] Therefore, the slogan
            should create a sense of likability in order for the brand name to be likable and the slogan message very
            clear and concise.</p>
        <p>Dass, Kumar, Kohli, & Thomas' (2014) research suggests that there are certain factors that make up the
            likability of a slogan. The clarity of the message the brand is trying to encode within the slogan. The
            slogan emphasizes the benefit of the product or service it is portraying. The creativity of a slogan is
            another factor that had a positive effect on the likability of a slogan. Lastly, leaving the brand name out
            of the slogan will have a positive effect on the likability of the brand itself.[5] Advertisers must keep
            into consideration these factors when creating a slogan for a brand, as it clearly shows a brand is a very
            valuable asset to a company, with the slogan being one of the three main components to a brands' image.</p>

        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>Slogans are used to convey a message about the product, service or cause that it is representing. It can have
            a musical tone to it or written as a song. Slogans are often used to capture the attention of the audience
            it is trying to reach. If the slogan is used for commercial purposes, often it is written to be
            memorable/catchy in order for a consumer to associate the slogan with the product it is representing.[8][9]
            A slogan is part of the production aspect that helps create an image for the product, service or cause it is
            representing. A slogan can be a few simple words used to form a phrase that can be used in a repetitive
            manner. In commercial advertising, corporations will use a slogan as part of promotional activity.[9]
            Slogans can become a global way of identifying a good or service, for example Nike's slogan 'Just Do It'
            helped establish Nike as an identifiable brand worldwide.</p>
        <p>Slogans should catch the audience's attention and influence the consumer's thoughts on what to purchase.[11]
            The slogan is used by companies to affect the way consumers view their product compared to others. Slogans
            can also provide information about the product, service or cause it is advertising. The language used in the
            slogans is essential to the message it wants to convey. Current words used can trigger different emotions
            that consumers will associate that product with.[11] The use of good adjectives makes for an effective
            slogan; when adjectives are paired with describing nouns, they help bring the meaning of the message out
            through the words.[12] When a slogan is used for advertising purposes its goal is to sell the product or
            service to as many consumers through the message and information a slogan provides.[13] A slogan's message
            can include information about the quality of the product.[13] Examples of words that can be used to direct
            the consumer preference towards a current product and its qualities are: good, beautiful, real, better,
            great, perfect, best, and pure.[14] Slogans can influence that way consumers behave when choosing what
            product to buy</p>
