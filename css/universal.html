    <p>The story takes place on the world of Draconis, where 2000 years ago a huge Dragon-Human War erupted. The golden Dragon of Legend chose a human rider, the Dragon Booster, to bring peace and show that dragons and humans can coexist.

        In the present day humans have been commanding dragons, the very thing the original Dragon Booster sought to prevent, and another war is looming. However, Connor Penn breeds back into existence one last gold dragon of legend, Beau. Beau chooses a stable boy, Artha Penn to be the Dragon Booster. Artha seeks to protect the world from the impending Dragon-Human war by defeating villains such as Moordryd Paynn and his father Word.</p>
