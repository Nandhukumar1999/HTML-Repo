            <h3>MSMEs demand release of pending subsidy for machinery</h3>


            <p>Coimbatore: The Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Medium Enterprises (TACT) has sought immediate
                release of 25% subsidy for machinery that has been pending for more than a year now.
                The state government offers 25% subsidy on the investment that the micro, small and medium enterprises
                (MSMEs) make in plant and machinery. The subsidy comes with an upper limit of ₹1.5 crore. The subsidy is
                given in a go.
                There is 10% additional subsidy as well for the micro enterprises and that is disbursed in various
                instalments.
                J James, district president, TACT, told TOI that around 250 MSME units in the district were yet to get
                the 25% subsidy. “Since the funds are yet to be released, the units are still paying interest on the
                loans they took to buy the machinery. Therefore, we are requesting the government to release the funds
                to save us from further financial burden.”</p>
