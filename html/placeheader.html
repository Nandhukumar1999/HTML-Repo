    <p>Jiraiya. Naruto with his mentor and godfather, Jiraiya. Unarguably one of the closest relationships Naruto ever had, Jiraiya indirectly played a role in his life even before he was born, as he was a mentor to both Minato and Nagato due to being foretold that a student under him would be destined for greatness.</p>
