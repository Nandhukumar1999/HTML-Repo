    <hr>
    <p>The new operating system started rolling out as an upgrade to PCs on October 4, 2021. Before taking the plunge to upgrade, you should first determine whether your PC can run Windows 11. The rollout will last through mid-2022, according to Microsoft, as the myriad PC hardware and software configurations are validated for compatibility. Keep an eye on PCMag's Windows 11 page for related tips and news. Now, let's get started with our look at the biggest new changes and features.The Taskbar icons are now centered and smaller like in Chrome OS, but the Start button is still to the left of the other app icons. Windows get tightly rounded corners, similar to macOS. I’m still not a fan of the always-narrow Taskbar buttons. In Windows 10 you get wide taskbar buttons for running apps that contrast with narrow icons for pinned apps. The centered look may win me over, however, since it doesn't require you to move the mouse cursor across a full screen to launch an app from the Start Menu.For me, Windows has long been unmatched in its ability to position, size, open, and close windows on the screen to your taste. (I’m still a fan of Aero Shake(Opens in a new window) for showing the desktop.) Apple's macOS only recently added the ability to set windows to take up exactly half the screen, something Windows users have had for years.
